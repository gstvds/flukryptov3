<h2>A brand new version of <a href='https://github.com/gstvds/flukryptov2'>flukrypto</a>, with big changes!
</h2>

Flukrypto is a cryptocurrency app to monitor the cryptocurrency market built for a summer internship.

## :bulb: Changelog

### :rocket: Ejecting from Expo and Using TypeScript

Maybe the biggest change so far. Flukrypto 2 was built in top of [Expo](https://expo.io). Although Expo is a good tool to develop React Native apps, it takes time to get the latests updates.

In order to get the best of RN features, Flukrypto is now built in top of React Native 0.62. And it also uses TypeScript :grin:

### :nail_care: Styled Components

I've always wanted to use Style Components with no specific reasons for that. So, now I am :bow:

### :tada: PulseJS

[PulseJS](https://pulsejs.org) is an open source global state and logic framework for React Native. It's a new framework and I'm trying to learn how to use it. So, I'm using in this project in order to learn more about this tool.

### :dancer: General Styles

Flukrypto 3 also have a different (and way better) interface now. Using fonts and colors that reminds it original inspiration ([Fluke](https://flu.ke)), with a brand new design (and functions).

## Work in Progress

Even though it's a new version, it's not ready yet. Some features are still missing and much more are still only on paper.
